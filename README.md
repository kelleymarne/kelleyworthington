## Description

> Challenge #20 React Portfolio

## Introduction 
This week we were instructed to create our portfolio or re-create our portfolio using React JS. I have created a polished looking UI that I feel is professional and clean.

## Challenges

Getting used to how react works is still a challenge. I am still learning this technology and all the capabilities it will have once I get more comfortable with this language. I did end up doing the CSS by hand because when trying to add on bootstrap or something it broke some of the things i had set up with standard CSS that i really did like on my page.

## Victories

I was able to get this set up pretty easily. Luckily I had put a lot of work into my portfolio when i first did this project. I was happy enough with it that i really decided to keep what i have and just to transform it into JSX with React. I was able to succesfully also add the ability to access my Resume.
