## Description

> Personal Portfolio using React 

## Introduction 


For this application, I took my previously static HTML/CSS portfolio and remade it using React. I kept all the styling the same because I really enjoyed the simplistic look and feel of it as it was. I really hope this page will highlight me as a professional as well as on a personal note as well.
